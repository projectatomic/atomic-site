Interested in Project Atomic? Looking to help make Fedora and CentOS Atomic Hosts even better? Join us for a half-day workshop at [DevConf.cz](http://devconf.cz/) in Brno on Saturday, 7 January 2015. 

After lunch, we'll meet to work on the Atomic Host Definition, plans for Fedora and CentOS Atomic Host, and projects that are essential to Project Atomic.

Full venue information can be found on the DevConf.cz site. We'll be meeting after lunch to work until end of day. You might also want to check out the [Cockpit Hackfest](http://developerconference2015.sched.org/event/411f41e00979698340f876b8a8119ef6?iframe=no#.VLlqyx36wa0) on Friday as well. 

Planning for the Workshop will take place on the atomic-devel mailing list, and a final agenda will be posted the week of 2 February. Questions? Ping Joe Brockmeier (jzb at Red Hat), or ask on atomic-devel@projectatomic.io or in #atomic on Freenode.
