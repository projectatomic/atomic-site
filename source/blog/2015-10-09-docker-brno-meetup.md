  * [Václav Pavlín](http://www.twitter.com/vpavlin) from Red Hat will present, "Nulecule - how to define, distribute and deploy multi-container applications."  There is no standard mechanism for creating, distributing and deploying multi-container applications.  The Nulecule specification solves this problem by allowing the definition, metadata, dependencies and orchestration provider configurations to be packaged up into a single usable unit.  This talk will also cover Atomic App, the reference implementation of Nulecule.

  * [Matteo Ferraroni](http://www.twitter.com/MatteoFerraroni) from Digital-blue will present, "Ceph and Docker: How to get persistent storage on the cloud."  Storage is a critical an widely unexplored issue with containers.  Matteo will help us move forward in this question and begin to answer how we can provision storage for our container applications.

  * [Yury Tsarev](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/yurytsarev) from GoodData will present, "Using docker together with test kitchen and serverspec for puppet test automation."  Learn how to win at "buzzword bingo" by combining two popular testing tools with docker to create a "test-driven infrastructure."

  * [Tomáš Nožička](https://cz.linkedin.com/in/tnozicka/en) from Seznam.cz will present, "Using docker for advanced testing, building packages for multiple distributions and altogether." This two-part presentation will start with a demonstration of using docker for unit testing when a database, such as MySQL, is required.  In the second part code will be tested and built in a clean environment for multiple distributions using docker.  In this second part we will explore using "docker in docker" and "docker next to docker" as part of the solution.

I look forward to seeing you there and to interacting with you and other community members.  Show up with questions and excitement.
