Earlier this week we released version [0.2.2](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/releases) of Atomic App. The first update since our major refactor in 0.2.1.

The release of __0.2.1__ introduced a [major refactor](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/pull/278) of our code base as well as numerous new features to Atomic App. Such as:

 * No more exporting to the current working directory when using __run__ or __install__ of Atomic App.
 * Installs are extracted to /var/lib/atomicapp by default.
 * JSON [pointer xpathing for artifact resources](https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/issues/70).

With __0.2.2__ we fix numerous bugs as well as introduce some dependency changes to our Atomic App Dockerfiles.

As we continue to push towards a 1.0.0 release we highly appreciate any comments or contributions to the Atomic App [repo](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp). If you have any questions about Atomic App or Nulecule, visit the #nulecule channel on Freenode or ask on the [container-tools](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/container-tools) mailing list.
