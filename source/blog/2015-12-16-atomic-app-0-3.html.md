Today we've released [0.3.0](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/releases) of Atomic App!

We've crossed a few things on our roadmap as well as introduced a brand-new provider; __Marathon!__

The main features of this release are:

  * Marathon provider (thank you [@kadel](https://github.com/kadel) and [@dharmit](https://github.com/dharmit)!)
  * A complete refactor of our OpenShift provider (using the HTTP API rather than oc command)
  * Support for `oc new-app` deployment
  * CLI options (ex. --answers-conf) may now be used anywhere on the command line

Bug fixes and changes:

  * A refactor of CLI commands and options
  * Fix on deploying multiple inherited applications

For a quick introduction to Marathon, feel free to examine the [helloapache](https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule-library/tree/master/helloapache) Nulecule example with Marathon already built in.

Simply add Marathon as a respective provider within `Nulecule`:

```yaml
---
...
    artifacts:
      docker:
        - file://artifacts/docker/hello-apache-pod_run
      kubernetes:
        - file://artifacts/kubernetes/hello-apache-pod.json
      marathon:
        - file://artifacts/marathon/helloapache.json
```

Then provide the JSON within the artifacts folder:

```json
{
  "id": "helloapache",
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
      "network": "BRIDGE",
      "image": "$image",
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "servicePort": $hostport,
          "hostPort": 0,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "cpus": 0.5,
  "mem": 128
}

```

Build, and launch!

```bash
docker build -t helloapache .
atomic run helloapache --provider=helloapache
```

As we continue to push towards a 1.0.0 release we highly appreciate any comments or contributions to the Atomic App [repo](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp).
