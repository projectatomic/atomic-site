Version 0.1.0 of the [vagrant-adbinfo plugin](https://github.com/projectatomic/vagrant-adbinfo) has been released by Project Atomic.

The vagrant-adbinfo plugin works in conjunction with the [Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB)](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/) to provide a Linux container development environment. The plugin is used to display the configuration information of services present in ADB. At the moment, plugin displays the configuration details for the Docker daemon running inside of the ADB. This information can be used by a docker-cli client or by an IDE, such as [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2015/june/article3.php), to interact with the ADB.

Notable Changes in this release include:

- Added gemspec in Gemfile to enable bundler packaging @lalatendumohanty
- Fix#67: OS is not a module (TypeError) on Windows @budhrg
- Update ADB box Atlas namespace to projectatomic/adb @lalatendumohanty
- Update README to reflect latest code and project goals @bexelbie
- Update Vagrantfile for QuickStart guide @navidshaikh
- Fix#66: Added CHANGELOG.md to repository @navidshaikh
