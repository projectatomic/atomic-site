Project Atomic is pleased to announce the release of the Atomic  Developer Bundle (ADB) 1.7.0, a Vagrant box that provides a ready-to-use  development environment for container applications. With the ADB,  developers can dive right into producing complex, multi-container  applications. The ADB is useful on Microsoft Windows, Apple’s OS X and  GNU/Linux distributions.

The 1.7.0 release adds several new features, including:

 * OpenShift is now managed as a systemd unit file with full functionality [start/stop/restart], making it a 
   single step to set up OpenShift on one machine. This will help application developers who want 
   to develop and test applications on OpenShift on their laptop or workstation.
 * The new SCCLI command-line tool, which can help users move between Kubernetes and OpenShift setup.
 * A new vagrant plugin, vagrant-service-manager, that manages the services inside of the ADB. 
   This plugin is recommended for use with the ADB and fully replaces vagrant-adbinfo
 
 This release also includes many smaller changes and bugfixes, which are detailed in the [release comments](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

### Learn More and Download

The ADB provides a container development ecosystem that ensures that  developers are able to work with Linux containers even if their base operating system does not support it. It also offers a quick and easy way to setup multi-container  applications that take advantage of management and/or orchestration  solutions, such as OpenShift or Kubernetes. The ADB supports [Nulecule](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/) and  [Atomic App](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/atomicapp/).  These projects provide a structure for packaging, distributing, and deploying multi-container applications.

The ADB is built as part of Project Atomic, which integrates the tools and patterns of container-based application and service deployment with trusted operating system platforms to deliver an end-to-end hosting architecture that's modern, reliable and secure.
