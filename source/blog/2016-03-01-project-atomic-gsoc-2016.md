Project Atomic will be participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/) for the first time this year.
So if you are a student, consider spending your summer (or winter in the Southern hemisphere)
hacking on container technology.  If you know a student, encourage them to apply.

We are participating as part of Fedora, so specifically we're looking for work on
any or all of the projects which are part of Fedora Atomic Host.  We have a list of
ideas on [our GSOC Page](/community/gsoc), and more detail on the
[Fedora GSOC Ideas wiki page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2016).
But, of course, you may have even better ideas for an interesting project!

Applications will [open on March 14th, and are due by March
25th](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).  But you can
get started now!  Get to know us by joining the [atomic-devel mailing list](https://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-devel)
and pitching your GSOC project idea, or meet our mentors and contributor
on #atomic or #fedora-cloud on IRC.freenode.net.
