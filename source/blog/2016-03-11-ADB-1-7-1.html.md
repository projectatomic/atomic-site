Project Atomic is pleased to announce the release of the Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB) 1.7.1, a Vagrant box that provides a ready-to-use development environment for container based applications. With the ADB, developers can dive right into producing complex, multi-container applications. The ADB is available for Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux distributions.

The 1.7.1 release is primarily a bug fix and enhancement release.

READMORE

* The OpenShift experience in ADB has been enhanced to be more streamlined and to make version selection easier.

* `sccli openshift` will download OpenShift images and setup a single-node OpenShift instance.  [Documentation](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-utils/blob/master/README.rst) is available online.

* `sccli` defaults to OpenShift Origin version 1.1.1.  This can be changed using environment variables as seen below.  For details, please see the [Documentation](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-utils/blob/master/README.rst).

```
# Use the latest version of OpenShift Origin
$ sudo IMAGE_TAG="latest" sccli openshift
```

* This release also includes many smaller changes and bug fixes, which are detailed in the release comments from  [adb-utils](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-utils/releases/tag/v1.1) and [ADB](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/releases/tag/v1.7.1).

## Learn More and Download

The ADB provides a container development ecosystem that ensures developers are able to work with Linux containers even if their base operating system does not support it. It also offers a quick and easy way to setup multi-container applications that take advantage of management and/or orchestration  solutions, such as OpenShift or Kubernetes. The ADB supports [Nulecule](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/) and [Atomic App](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/atomicapp/). These projects provide a structure for packaging, distributing, and deploying multi-container applications.

The ADB is built as part of Project Atomic, which integrates the tools and patterns of container-based application and service deployment with trusted operating system platforms to deliver an end-to-end hosting architecture that's modern, reliable, and secure.
