Atomic App verison 0.4.5 has been released! In this minor release of Atomic App we make some changes to the UI output as well as fix a few provider-specific bugs.

The main features of this release are:

  - Cleaner logging output
  - More prominent output when Atomic App asks for a missing answers variable
  - Multi-line artifact support for the Docker provider

Other:

  - Update documentation on cli comparison
  - Move kubeconfig parsing to a separate class
  - Refactor cli exceptions code
