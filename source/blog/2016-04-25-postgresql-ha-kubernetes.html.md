I'm going to begin our video series here on projectatomic.io with a video of my presentation from KubeCon 2016, "Full Automatic Database."  This presentation explains the design of a prototype high availability version of PostgreSQL, using Kubernetes on Atomic Host.

In addition to sharing the video with you, this also explains a bit how I got into containers starting from the world of databases.  Container infrastructures, particularly orchestrators like Kubernetes, offer a lot of opportunities to make up for the lack of automation in the database platform.

Right now, [my little project for this](https://github.com/jberkus/atomicdb) is just a prototype.  I'm working on some upstream dependencies in order to make it fully bulletproof and feature-complete.  I'll be posting more about that later.

More videos on this blog weekly from here on out.
