In this weeks release of Atomic App we not only have cleaner logging output when using the tool, but we've also added binary generation!

The main features of this release are:
  - Cleaning logging
  - Binary generation
  - README.MD generation removed from `atomicapp init`

READMORE

Other:

  - Code cleanup / minor code modifications (dictionary searches, loops)
  - Provider module / class loading refactoring

## Cleaner logging

We've completed a clean-up on how we log Atomic App. With this release we've added ASCII art as well as cleaned up a lot of the redundant information outputted when deploying an Atomic App.

```
▶ atomicapp run projectatomic/helloapache --destination helloapache --provider=docker

## Binary generation

You'll now be able to generate a stand-alone binary for Atomic App without the need of having Python installed onto your system. This increases portability and is compatible with all Linux-based operating systems.

Simply use `make binary` in the root folder of the Atomic App source code and your binary will be generated!

```
▶ make binary
...
Binary created at bin/atomicapp
```
