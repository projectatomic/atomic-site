This release of Atomic App introduces a large code-base change related to our Kubernetes provider. 

We incorporate major changes to the Kubernetes provider. With this release we replace the usage of `kubectl` with the *requests* Python library and the Kubernetes HTTP API end-point. This change results in faster deployment, smaller image sizes and increased detail in logging messages.

The main features of this release are:

* Kubectl to API conversion
* Removal of ASCII art
