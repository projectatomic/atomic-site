Last month we introduced
[Commissaire](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2016/05/introducing_commissaire/)
giving a quick overview of features and architecture. This month we
wanted to show how one can:

* Run a Commissaire server
* Configure commctl for use with Commissaire
* Create a new cluster via commctl
* Bootstrap a new host node via commctl
* ssh to a host node via commctl
