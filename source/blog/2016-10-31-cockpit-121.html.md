Cockpit has posted [its 121st release this week](http://cockpit-project.org/blog/cockpit-121.html).

Cockpit is the modern Linux admin interface. We release regularly. Here
are the release notes from version 121.

## Network Configuration Rollback

NetworkManager now has support in its API for detecting whether a
network configuration change broke connectivity to the system. Marius
did work so that Cockpit can detect this and have NetworkManager
rollback the changes that would have caused a remote admin to be
disconnected from the system.

This is similar to how a Linux desktop asks you to click in a dialog
if you accept the new display configuration. Except in the networking
case we can test the connectivity automatically.

## Debugging info for Javascript and CSS

Cockpit now ships proper Javascript and CSS debugging "map" files in its
cockpit-debuginfo packages. These make it easier to troubleshoot issues
and develop code that runs in Cockpit.

## Debian Branding

Cockpit now shows proper branding when running on Debian, and uses the
logo installed on the system on its login screen.

## Fix Kerberos single sign on Debian and Ubuntu

Stef fixed Kerberos single sign on Debian and Ubuntu. More changes are
coming in the next release including support for use with gssproxy and
expanding support for non-Kerberos GSSAPI authentication mechanisms.
