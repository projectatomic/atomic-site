[rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.org/) is the
hybrid image/package system that provides transactional
upgrades on Atomic Host. Here are some highlights from
version
[v2017.6](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/releases/tag/v2017.6).

READMORE

The highlight of this release is experimental support for
live system updates. You can test it out by
[rebasing your Fedora Atomic Host](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing#Using_it_with_Atomic_Host_.28Fedora_24_and_later.29)
onto the testing branch. Feel free to also leave karma in
the pending Bodhi updates:

- [Fedora 25 update](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-85014ae3f6)
- [Fedora 26 update](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-f86a299577)

### Live updates

rpm-ostree is now capable of applying some updates live
without the need to reboot using the `rpm-ostree ex livefs`
command. This works only in situations where the only
difference between the pending deployment and the current
deployment is added packages. You can see it in action
below:

```
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
* vmcheck
              Timestamp: 2017-06-02 19:45:32

# ltrace
bash: ltrace: command not found
# rpm -q ltrace

```

We don't have ltrace installed. Let's overlay it:

```
# rpm-ostree install ltrace

```

Normally, at this point, we'd have to reboot. However, since
we just added a package, we can use the `livefs` command
instead to get the changes immediately applied:

```
# rpm-ostree ex livefs
notice: "livefs" is an experimental command and subject to change.

```

The `livefs` command helpfully created a rollback deployment
of the original commit we booted into because it modifies
the deployment itself permanently. You can see this
modification reflected in the output of the `status`
command:

```
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
  vmcheck
              Timestamp: 2017-06-02 19:45:32

             LiveCommit: f71fedccd227b5112b461b466106e069bf2c1c2de21f1554abda72297594e8a0

```

The `BootedCommit` is the commit we original started with,
whereas the `LiveCommit` is the commit that was applied to
the live deployment.

This feature is still in experimental mode, and thus is
subject to change. Discussions are still ongoing upstream as
to the finer details of the command and expected use cases.

### Repodata caching

You might have noticed this bit in the output above:

```
Enabled rpm-md repositories: fedora-cisco-openh264 updates fedora jlebon
rpm-md repo 'fedora-cisco-openh264' (cached); generated: 2017-03-24 17:58:10
rpm-md repo 'updates' (cached); generated: 2017-06-02 01:51:29
rpm-md repo 'fedora' (cached); generated: 2016-11-15 19:49:18
rpm-md repo 'jlebon' (cached); generated: 2017-05-08 16:24:16
```

rpm-ostree now caches repo metadata for up to a day, and
prints this information during layering operations. One can
do `cleanup -m` in order to purge the metadata and force a
refresh.

### Journal logging

The rpm-ostree daemon now logs more and more information to
the journal to help sysadmins understand system state and to
diagnose issues. Here are some sample journal outputs from
the operations above:

```
rpm-ostree[1276]: Preparing pkg txn; enabled repos: ['updates', 'fedora', 'jlebon'] solvables: 71435
rpm-ostree[1276]: Imported 1 pkg
...
rpm-ostree[1276]: Starting livefs for commit f71fedccd227b5112b461b466106e069bf2c1c2de21f1554abda72297594e8a0 addition; 1 pkgs, 15 files
rpm-ostree[1276]: Completed livefs for commit f71fedccd227b5112b461b466106e069bf2c1c2de21f1554abda72297594e8a0
```

Many of these journal entries actually use the structured
output feature of journald. For example, there is a
dedicated
[MESSAGE_ID](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.journal-fields.html)
for reporting repo information during package transactions:

```
# journalctl -b 0 MESSAGE_ID=0eea679bbfa34d43802dec99b274ebe7 -o json-pretty
{
        ...
        "MESSAGE_ID" : "0eea679bbfa34d43802dec99b274ebe7",
        "MESSAGE" : "Preparing pkg txn; enabled repos: ['updates', 'fedora', 'jlebon'] solvables: 71435",
        "SACK_N_SOLVABLES" : "71881",
        "ENABLED_REPOS" : "['updates', 'fedora', 'jlebon']",
        "ENABLED_REPOS_SOLVABLES" : "[19748, 51669, 18]",
        "ENABLED_REPOS_TIMESTAMPS" : "[1496368289, 1479239358, 1494260656]",
        ...
}
```

### Other minor fixes and improvements

There are many other small improvements, here are a few:

- rpm-ostree is now more diligent about checking whether
  RPMs from repos are the same as locally cached RPMs.
  Previously, two different RPMs with the same name and
  version would be considered equivalent. We now store the
  actual package checksum and do a comparison to verify
  this.

- on the compose side, rpm-ostree now supports a new
  `tmp-is-dir` field, which allows for example, systemd to
  mount a tmpfs on startup, rather than using a central
  permanent `/tmp` directory.

- rpm-ostree is now capable of rebasing to a local branch
  using the `rebase :local-branch` syntax. This was
  previously not possible if the current refspec was from a
  remote.
