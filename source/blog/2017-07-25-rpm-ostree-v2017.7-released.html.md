[rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.org/) is the
hybrid image/package system that provides transactional
upgrades on Atomic Host. Here are some highlights from
version
[v2017.7](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/releases/tag/v2017.7),
including PolicyKit and experimental overrides support.

READMORE

As usual, you can test out this release by
[rebasing your Fedora Atomic Host](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing#Using_it_with_Atomic_Host_.28Fedora_24_and_later.29)
onto the testing branch. Feel free to also leave karma in
the pending Bodhi updates:

- [Fedora 25 update](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-45adcbb9a3)
- [Fedora 26 update](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2017-483c7979ee)

Note that this is the final release of rpm-ostree on Fedora
25 as we focus our efforts on Fedora 26.

### Experimental support for overrides

The most visible change in this release is the addition of a
new `ex` subcommand: `rpm-ostree ex override` (the `ex`
command groups new features that are not ready to be
declared stable; details of how these commands work may
change in the future).

Whereas the `install` command allows you to overlay packages
on top of the base commit received from your content
provider, the `override` command allows you to modify the
set of packages in the base commit itself. For example, you
may want to remove a package that conflicts with an overlay,
or more interestingly, update a package to a newer version
to fix a bug.

Of course, such modifications should be done with care,
since they in effect "void" the warranty implied by an
ostree commit. However, these powerful semantics enable us
to take the image/package hybrid paradigm to a new level.
Thanks to rpm-ostree, you can easily keep track of every
deviation from the base image.

The `override` command supports two subcommands: `remove`
and `replace`.

### Removal overrides

Not surprisingly, the `remove` subcommand allows you remove
a base package. Let's see it in action!

The host below has `strace` installed and no packages
layered:

```
# rpm-ostree status

Let's now add an override to remove `strace`:

Let's confirm that `strace` is truly gone:

```

We can remove the override by using the `reset` command:

```
# rpm-ostree ex override reset strace

       RemovedBasePackages: strace-4.18-1.fc26.x86_64
```

### Replacement overrides

Similarly, the `replace` subcommand allows you to replace a
base package with a different version. For now, you can only
replace packages using local RPMs.

In this example, instead of removing `strace`, we will
upgrade it. On this machine, I've got v4.17 installed:

```
# rpm -q strace
strace-4.17-1.fc26.x86_64
```

I've also got the build for the next version, v4.18, handy:

```
# ls -l strace-*.rpm
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 659434 Jul 24 16:58 strace-4.18-1.fc26.x86_64.rpm
```

And now, we can add an override to replace `strace`:

```
# rpm-ostree ex override replace strace-4.18-1.fc26.x86_64.rpm

Run "systemctl reboot" to start a reboot
```

And finally, let's reboot to check that it worked:

```
# reboot
...
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle

      ReplacedBasePackages: strace 4.17-1.fc26 -> 4.18-1.fc26

  fedora-atomic:fedora/26/x86_64/testing/atomic-host
                   Version: 26.91 (2017-07-23 09:39:09)

[root@f25-ros-dev2 ~]# rpm -q strace
strace-4.18-1.fc26.x86_64
[root@f25-ros-dev2 ~]# strace -V | grep version
strace -- version 4.18
```

Of course, this can be used for more meaningful packages as
well, like `docker` and `kubernetes`. For example, here I'm
updating `kubernetes` to the latest build I could find in
Koji (with complete disregard to matching the distro):

```
# rpm -q kubernetes
kubernetes-1.5.3-1.fc26.x86_64
# kube-apiserver --version
Kubernetes v1.5.3
# # ls -l kubernetes-*.rpm
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root    43446 Jul 24 17:12 kubernetes-1.7.1-1.fc27.x86_64.rpm

```

We'll look to cleaning up the status output in the future in
cases where multiple related subpackages are updated.

### PolicyKit support for D-Bus API

rpm-ostree now ships with a polkit policy. This is primarily
motivated by work underway to support rpm-ostree in GNOME
Software, though it's useful in the server case as well.
It is currently visible only at the D-Bus API level; for
now, the rpm-ostree CLI tool still needs to be run as root
for most operations. In the future, users will be able to
authenticate directly from the terminal and thus avoid
having to use `sudo` completely.

### Other minor fixes and improvements

There are many other small improvements, here are a few:

- rpm-ostree now logs even more information to the journal.

- rpm-ostree now shows GPG signatures only in the output of
  `status` and does so in a less verbose way.

  Instead of this output:

  ```
  GPGSignature: 1 signature
                Signature made Fri Jul  7 13:19:06 2017 using RSA key ID 812A6B4B64DAB85D
                Good signature from "Fedora 26 Primary <fedora-26-primary@fedoraproject.org>"
  ```

  rpm-ostree now prints this:

  ```
  GPGSignature: Valid signature by E641850B77DF435378D1D7E2812A6B4B64DAB85D
  ```

As usual, you can see the full list of changes in the
[release notes](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/releases/tag/v2017.7).
