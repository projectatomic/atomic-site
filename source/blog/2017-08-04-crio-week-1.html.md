There's been a lot of activity on the CRI-O container runtime project, as well as on their [new blog](https://medium.com/cri-o/introducing-the-cri-o-blog-site-afe603ac5248).  The big news is the release of [the CRI-O 1.0 beta](https://medium.com/cri-o/announcing-cri-o-1-0-0-beta-0-f593637343b2), of course.

Let me summarize the rest for the sake of those catching up with the project.

Dan Walsh's team is hard at work [packaging CRI-O and skopeo for multiple platforms](https://medium.com/cri-o/making-packages-available-for-other-distributions-33bc8818b44e).  This includes RPMs and containers for Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, and SuSE.  Mrunal Patel summarized [the goals of the CRI-O project](https://medium.com/cri-o/cri-o-198c84185c94).

Walsh then announced [support for signed container images](https://medium.com/cri-o/support-for-signed-images-d7d6a0721f8b) in CRI-O.  Three days later, Patel announced that [CRI-O now supports configuring Docker storage volumes](https://medium.com/cri-o/cri-o-configurable-image-volume-support-dda7b54f4bda), and Antonio Murdaca explained [how CRI-O handles default registries](https://medium.com/cri-o/default-container-registry-revisited-50b32dd808fe).

It's been a super-busy week in the CRI-O project, and we can expect the activity to continue through the eventual 1.0 release.
