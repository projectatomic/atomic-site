This year's [Flock to Fedora](https://flocktofedora.org/) contributor conference is chock-full of Atomic project work.  If you're interested in Atomic Host, containers, and Kubernetes, you'll have plenty to do for the whole week in Cape Cod.  Sessions will cover maintaining containers, writing docs, the FLIBS build system, building alternate-arch containers, and much more. And if you're in the Boston area ... there's still time to [register](https://register.flocktofedora.org/)!

Read through for a list of sessions.

## Regular Sessions

Atomic is so much of Fedora these days, about 1/4 of the program is Atomic-related.  Sessions include the following:

* [Atomic Host 101](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm97/atomic-host-101) will explain Atomic Host to Fedora members who are new to the platform.
* [Multi-Arch Container Layered Image Build System](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm9F/multi-arch-container-layered-image-build-system), covering how Fedora is planning to have ARM and PPC containers.
* [New Container Technologies](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm9d/new-container-technologies) covers the various Atomic projects around building and deploying containers.
* The [System Containers](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm9U/system-containers-concept-creation-and-usage) session will show you how to make your own system containers for installing key software.
* A [Kubernetes vs. OpenShift](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm9T/discussing-kubernetes-origin-deployment-options) talk will explain the two kinds of Atomic clusters and how to handle each.
* Fedora engineering folks will explain [how we're using OpenShift in the Fedora Infrastucture](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm94/on-openshift-in-fedora-infrastructure).
* You can find out how to [set up your own Atomic Workstation](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm9Y/setup-your-own-atomic-workstation).
* Need to create your own custom OStrees?  [Use Ansible](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm9b/automate-building-custom-atomic-host-with-ansible).

## Work Sessions

More than anything, we want you to contribute to Atomic.  As such, we've created the following Work Sessions for you to get started with some hands-on contributions:

* [Become a Container Maintainer](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm9B/become-a-container-maintainer), because we need you to create, maintain, and review container images for FLIBS!
* Help us create a new Administrator Guide for Atomic Host in this [Doc Work Session](https://flock2017.sched.com/event/Bm9S/fedora-atomic-doc-work).

See you at Flock!
