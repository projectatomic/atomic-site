[rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.org/) is the
hybrid image/package system that provides transactional
upgrades on Atomic Host. Here are some highlights from
version
[v2017.8](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/releases/tag/v2017.8),
including better PolicyKit integration and support for RPM file triggers.

READMORE

You can test it out by rebasing to the
[latest Fedora Atomic Host release](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2017/09/fedora-atomic-26-120/)
or [downloading it](https://getfedora.org/en/atomic/download/).

### Better PolicyKit integration

In this release, we built upon the PolicyKit support added
in the previous release to allow authentication directly
from the terminal. This means that users can now run
rpm-ostree operations as non-root and only authenticate for
the operation requested instead of resorting to `sudo`:

```
[cloud-user@f26-tmp ~]$ rpm-ostree status
State: idle
Deployments:
* fedora-atomic:fedora/26/x86_64/atomic-host
                   Version: 26.120 (2017-09-05 00:05:09)
                    Commit: 0b0127864022dd6ffad1a183241fbd5482ef5a1642ff3c8751c2e6cae6070b1a

### Support for RPM file triggers

When layering packages, rpm-ostree essentially re-implements
parts of the functionality of `rpm`. For example, RPM
scriptlets are run in a locked down environment to ensure
minimal exposure. In this release, rpm-ostree added support
for running [file trigger scriptlets](http://rpm.org/user_doc/file_triggers.html).
This is necessary for successfully layering some packages,
such as `vagrant`.

### Upgrade command also upgrades layered packages

Previously, the `upgrade` command only layered a new
deployment if a new ostree commit was available, regardless
of whether new versions were available for layered packages.
This was fixed in this release so that `upgrade` always
checks for outdated layered packages even if there are no
new commits.

### Better help output

For commands that take subcommands, the help output now
outputs a description of each subcommand. This is especially
useful on Atomic Host, where man pages are not readily
available.

```
[cloud-user@f26-tmp ~]$ rpm-ostree --help
Usage:
  rpm-ostree [OPTION?] COMMAND

Builtin Commands:
  compose          Commands to compose a tree
  cleanup          Clear cached/pending data
  db               Commands to query the RPM database
  deploy           Deploy a specific commit
  rebase           Switch to a different tree
  rollback         Revert to the previously booted tree
  status           Get the version of the booted system
  upgrade          Perform a system upgrade
  reload           Reload configuration
  initramfs        Enable or disable local initramfs regeneration
  install          Download and install layered RPM packages
  uninstall        Remove one or more overlay packages

Help Options:
  -h, --help       Show help options

Application Options:
  --version        Print version information and exit
```

### Other minor fixes and improvements

There are many other small improvements, here are a few:

- rpm-ostree learned about the `ostree.endoflife` metadata
  key, which displays an informative message when an OS
  stream (branch) reaches end-of-life. This will likely be
  used for Fedora Atomic Host.

Upstream patches: https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/pull/889

- rpm-ostree was submitted to
  [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/) and received many
  fixes detected in the scan. No major issues were
  uncovered.
