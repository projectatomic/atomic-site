Project Atomic contributors and projects will be represented at many events
in October.  If you're coming to any of these events, drop by
and say hello!

**All Things Open**: Charlie Drage will be presenting [Kompose: Going from Docker
Compose to Kubernetes and Beyond](https://allthingsopen.org/talk/kompose-going-from-docker-compose-to-kubernetes-and-beyond/).
It's likely that he and Dusty Mabe will also be around the Red Hat booth; drop by.

**Open Source Summit Europe**: Tomas Tomecek will be presenting [From Dockerfiles to Ansible Container](https://osseu17.sched.com/event/BxIW/from-dockerfiles-to-ansible-container-tomas-tomecek-red-hat)
and Stef Walters will be presenting [Training Machines to be Open Source Contributors](https://osseu17.sched.com/event/ByIY/training-machines-to-be-open-source-contributors-stef-walter-red-hat-inc).
Also, while not strictly part of Atomic, [Container Migration](https://osseu17.sched.com/event/BxIG/container-migration-around-the-world-adrian-reber-red-hat-and-mike-rapoport-ibm-research)
looks pretty cool.  Plus, come visit the Red Hat booth where Cockpit contributors will
demonstrate the latest releases of the most modern server GUI.

**Usenix LISA**: On Sunday, you can choose between [two workshops](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/training-program): Mark Lamourine's *Container Hosts: CoreOS and Project Atomic* and Ryan Jarvinen's *Hands-on Intro to Kubernetes*  We will also have a [BOF on the evening of Wednesday, November 1st](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/bofs) on Migrating to
Containers, OpenShift, or Atomic Host.  Join us in the Garden Room at 7pm. Then on Friday you can learn about [OpenSCAP](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa17/conference-program/presentation/preisler) with Martin Preisler and Marek Haicman. Plus,
we'll have Atomic Host and OpenShift contributors at the Red Hat booth.
