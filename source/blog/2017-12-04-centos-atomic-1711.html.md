Last week, the CentOS Atomic SIG released an [updated version](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic/Download) of CentOS Atomic Host (7.1711), a lean operating system designed to run Linux containers, built from standard CentOS 7 RPMs, and tracking the component versions included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host.

This release rolls up a handful of minor CentOS updates from the past month. The core Atomic component versions are unchanged from those in the previous release (7.1710).

CentOS Atomic Host includes these core component versions:

* atomic-1.19.1-5.git48c224b.el7.centos.x86_64
* cloud-init-0.7.9-9.el7.centos.2.x86_64
* docker-1.12.6-61.git85d7426.el7.centos.x86_64
* etcd-3.2.7-1.el7.x86_64
* flannel-0.7.1-2.el7.x86_64
* kernel-3.10.0-693.5.2.el7.x86_64
* kubernetes-node-1.5.2-0.7.git269f928.el7.x86_64
* ostree-2017.11-1.el7.x86_64
* rpm-ostree-client-2017.9-1.atomic.el7.x86_64

## Download CentOS Atomic Host

CentOS Atomic Host is available as a VirtualBox or libvirt-formatted Vagrant box, or as an installable ISO, qcow2 or Amazon Machine image. For links to media, see the [CentOS wiki](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic/Download).

## Upgrading

If you're running a previous version of CentOS Atomic Host, you can upgrade to the current image by running the following command:

```bash
# atomic host upgrade
```

## Release Cycle

The CentOS Atomic Host image follows the upstream Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host cadence. After sources are released, they're rebuilt and included in new images. After the images are tested by the SIG and deemed ready, we announce them.

## Getting Involved

CentOS Atomic Host is produced by the [CentOS Atomic SIG](http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic), based on upstream work from  [Project Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io/). If you'd like to work on testing images, help with packaging, documentation -- join us! 

The SIG meets every two weeks as part of the Project Atomic community meeting at 16:00 UTC on Monday in the #atomic channel. You'll often find us in #atomic and/or #centos-devel if you have questions. You can also join the [atomic-devel](https://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-devel) mailing list if you'd like to discuss the direction of Project Atomic, its components, or have other questions. 

## Getting Help

If you run into any problems with the images or components, feel free to ask on the [centos-devel](http://lists.centos.org/mailman/listinfo/centos-devel) mailing list.
