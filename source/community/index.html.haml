  The Atomic project aims to build a welcoming and diverse community
  around the various components needed to compose, deploy and manage
  Atomic hosts and applications inside.

%p

  The Atomic project relies on several open source
  projects as the building blocks used for the project. For the hosts
  it relies heavily on
  %a( href="http://kernel.org/") linux kernel
  features, the
  %a( href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/" ) systemd
  system and service manager,
  %a( href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/OSTree" ) OSTree
  and
  %a( href="http://rpm-ostree.cloud.fedoraproject.org/" ) rpm-ostree
  for updates,
  %a( href="https://www.docker.io/" ) Docker
  and
  %a( href="https://index.docker.io/u/ccoleman/geard/" ) geard
  for application deployment, and of course the various targeted Linux
  distributions.
  The Atomic community will work toward development of the Atomic project
  in an inclusive way by contributing to the related upstream projects,
  solving integration issues in the various distributions being used and
  developing the specific management tools needed for management and
  system updates.
