%p.lead

  Please have a look to the
  %a( href="/docs/introduction/" ) Introduction to Project Atomic
  to get a first idea about the goals and scope of the project.

%h2 Getting Started

%p

  To quickly get Atomic up and running please follow the instructions
  from our
  <a href="/docs/quickstart/">Quick Start Guide</a>.

%p

  Then check our
  %a( href="/docs/gettingstarted/" ) Getting Started Guide
  to make your first steps with your new Atomic setup.

    %h3 Updating the Atomic Host 

    %p
      Atomic hosts are 
      %a( href="/docs/os-updates" ) updated
      using a tool called rpm-ostree. An easy way to think about
      rpm-ostree and its parent project 
      %a( href="http://live.gnome.org/Projects/OSTree" ) OSTree
      is "git for operating systems."

    %p 
      Using rpm-ostree we can easily update the system in one "atomic"
      transaction, and roll back to the prior system if an update has any
      issues.

    %h3 Managing Storage

    %p
      To set up additional storage for /var/lib/docker see
      %a( href="/docs/docker-storage-recommendation" ) Setting Up Storage
      and when considering alternative filesystems see
      <a href="/docs/filesystems">Supported Filesystems</a>.

  .col-md-4.col-sm-12
    %h3 Atomic: /usr/bin/atomic

    %p
      The Atomic 
      %a( href="/docs/usr-bin-atomic" ) (/usr/bin/atomic) Documentation
      explains how to use the atomic command on Atomic hosts. This command
      defines the entrypoint for Project Atomic hosts. 

    %p
      The goal of 
      %a( href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic/" ) /usr/bin/atomic
      is to provide a high-level, coherent entrypoint to the system, and fill
      in gaps that are not filled by Linux container implementations.

    %h3 Building New Images

    %p
      The
      %a( href="/docs/docker-building-images" ) Building Docker Images
      provides guidelines on how to build new Docker images for your
      application deployments, and the
      %a( href="/docs/docker-image-author-guidance" ) Docker Image Author Guidance
      gives a set of explanations and tips which will help authoring new
      Docker images.

    %h3 Containment and Security

    %p
      Beyond the isolation provided by containers, Atomic relies on
      Security-Enhanced Linux to improve the security of the host and
      between containers, see
      %a( href="/docs/docker-and-selinux" ) Docker and SELinux
      for details of the increased protection available.

  .col-md-4.col-sm-12
    %h3 Networking

    %p
      When an application is composed using multiple containers
      it can be a bit complex to provide for communication without
      losing flexibility. Learn about 
      %a( href="/docs/atomic-host-networking" ) Atomic host networking
      options for single and multi-host configurations.

  How to Contribute to the Documentation

%p

  Atomic is a work in progress, and documentation needs to follow the
  pace of the developments.

%p
  To help achieve this, the documentation (as well as the whole
  web site) is available from the 
  %a( href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-site/" ) atomic-site
  repository on GitHub as part of the
  %a( href="https://github.com/projectatomic/" ) projectatomic
  framework.
  Most of the documents are simply written in the
  %a( href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" ) Markdown
  plain text formatting syntax, they are as a result easy to edit and
  extend, simply clone the atomic site and edit them under the
  %code sources/docs/
  directory. If you add a new file please also register it in
  %code data/docs.yml
  \. Then send us a pull request on GitHub or the resulting patch to the
  %a( href="http://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-devel" ) atomic-devel
  mailing-list if you prefer. Thanks !

%p
  The web site itself is available in the
  %a( href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-site/" ) atomic-site
  repository on GitHub, it is build using
  %a( href="http://middlemanapp.com/" ) Middleman
  framework, see the
  %code README.md
  at the top of the git checkout for informations. It also uses
  %a( href="http://haml.info/" ) Haml
  for more complex formatting of some pages, check the
  %a( href="http://haml.info/tutorial.html" ) Tutorial
  to get started editing some of the haml pages.
