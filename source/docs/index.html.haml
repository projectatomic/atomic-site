    %h3 Updating the Atomic controller

    %p

      Atomic uses a new way to manage updates of the base
      operating system. 
      %a( href="/docs/os-updates" ) Operating System upgrades via rpm-ostree
      provides some details about it. See also the online pages for the
      %a( href="http://rpm-ostree.cloud.fedoraproject.org/" ) rpm-ostree
      project and the
      %a( href="http://live.gnome.org/Projects/OSTree" ) OSTree
      library.

    %h3 Containment and Security

    %p
      In addition to the isolation provided by containers, Atomic relies on
      Security-Enhanced Linux to improve the security of the host and
      the security between containers. See
      %a( href="/docs/docker-and-selinux" ) Docker and SELinux
      for details of the increased protection available for your hosts and containers.

    %h3 Networking

    %p
      When an application is composed using multiple containers
      it can be complex to make them communicate without
      losing flexibility. The
      %a( href="/docs/inter-container-networking" ) Inter-container networking
      page provides a solution for such setups.

  How to contribute to the documentation

%p

  Atomic is a work in progress, and documentation should follow the
  pace of the developments.

%p
  To help achieve this, the documentation (as well as the whole
  web site) is available from the 
  %a( href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-site/" ) atomic-site
  repository on GitHub as part of the
  %a( href="https://github.com/projectatomic/" ) projectatomic
  framework.
  Most of the documents are simply written in the
  %a( href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" ) Markdown
  plain text formatting syntax, and are easy to edit and
  extend. Simply clone the atomic site and edit them under the
  %code sources/docs/
  directory. If you add a new file please also register it in
  %code data/docs.yml
  \. Then send us a pull request on GitHub or the resulting patch to the
  %a( href="http://lists.projectatomic.io/mailman/listinfo/atomic-devel" ) atomic-devel
  mailing-list if you prefer. Thanks !

%p
  The web site itself is available in the
  %a( href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-site/" ) atomic-site
  repository on GitHub, it is build using
  %a( href="http://middlemanapp.com/" ) Middleman
  framework, see the
  %code README.md
  at the top of the git checkout for informations. It also uses
  %a( href="http://haml.info/" ) Haml
  for more complex formatting of some pages, check the
  %a( href="http://haml.info/tutorial.html" ) Tutorial
