Inter-container Software Defined Networking using iptables
====================================================

Geard uses iptables to enable containers to connect to connect to each other. Network namespaces allows
adding iptables rules to the network namespace of a container. The basic idea is to make remote endpoints
appear as if they are local to a container. For e.g. the db container could be made to appear to be running
locally inside an application container. 

To make this work, ip_forwarding and localnet_routing are enabled within a container:

    /usr/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    /usr/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1
    
Next, NAT rules are added to map the remote endpoint to a local endpoint:

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d ${local_ip}/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport ${local_port} -j DNAT --to-destination ${remote_ip}:${remote_port}
    iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d ${local_ip}/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport ${local_port} -j DNAT --to-destination ${remote_ip}:${remote_port}
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to-source ${container_ip}
  
If there are two containers, say an application container and a db container, then it would make
sense to link the db container to the application container. If the application container is
running on host 1 and the db container is on host 2 (10.16.138.101:49153), then running the rules above
using gear link would make the db container appear to run on the localhost:3306 of the application container.

    gear link -n "127.0.0.1:3306:10.16.138.101:49153" server/application_container_1
    
Two advantages of this approach are:
 * The application code or configuration to connect to the database doesn't have to change for all instances of the application container.
 * The database container could be moved to any host and the application would just have to flush and rerun gear link to point to the new location.
