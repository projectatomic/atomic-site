# Introduction to Project Atomic

Project Atomic facilitates application-centric IT architecture by providing an end-to-end solution for deploying containerized applications quickly and reliably, with "atomic" update and rollback for application and host alike.

The core of Project Atomic is the Project Atomic Controller. This is a lightweight operating system that has been assembled out of upstream RPM content. It is designed to run applications in Docker containers. Controllers based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora are available now. Controllers based on CentOS will be available soon.

Project Atomic controllers inherit the full features and advantages of their base distributions. This includes systemd, which provides container-dependency managment and fault recovery. It also includes journald, which provides secure aggregation and attribution of container logs. Project Atomic builds on these features, using the following components, which have been tailored for containerized-application management:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.io/), an open-source project for creating lightweight, portable, self-sufficient application containers.
* [rpm-OSTree](http://rpm-ostree.cloud.fedoraproject.org/#/), an open-source tool for managing bootable, immutable, versioned filesystem trees from upstream RPM content.
* [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/), an open-source system and service manager for Linux.
* [geard](https://github.com/smarterclayton/geard), an open-source project for installing and linking Docker containers into systemd, and for coordinating those Docker containers across hosts.Â  geard is the core of the next-generation of OpenShift.

## How can Project Atomic Help me?

* The traditional enterprise OS model with a single runtime environment controlled by the OS and shared by all applications does not meet the requirements of modern application-centric IT.
* The complexity of the software stack, the amount of different stacks, and the speed of change have overwhelmed the ability of a single monolithic stack to deliver in a consistent way.
* Developer/DevOps-led shops seek control over the runtime underneath their applications, without necessarily owning the entire stack.
* VMs provide a means for separation among applications, but this model adds significant resource and management overhead.

Slimming down the host with the Atomic distribution limits the surface area and patch frequency for administrators.  Docker containers offer developers and admins a clear path to delivering consistent and fully tested stacks from development to production.  Containers secured with Linux namespaces, cGroups, and SELinux give isolation close to that of a VM, with much greater flexibility and efficiency.  And simple, easy-to-use tools like geard and Cockpit provide cross-cluster capabilities to deploy and manage applications.
