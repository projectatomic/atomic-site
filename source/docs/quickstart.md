# Project Atomic Quick Start Guide

We recommend reading the Getting Started Guide and Concepts Guide if you're entirely new to the concept of Atomic and Docker. But, we also wanted to provide a **Quick Start Guide** (or "guide for the impatient") for folks who just want to plow through and see what all the fuss is about. 

## What You Need

* **A virtualization client.** [Virtual Machine Manager](http://virt-manager.org/) is a very good KVM-based client for Linux systems. Windows and OS X users can give [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) a try. Be sure your virtualization client is properly configured to access the Internet.

* **A virtual machine image.** Images for Atomic based on Fedora 20 can be found at the [rpm-ostree project](http://rpm-ostree.cloud.fedoraproject.org/project-atomic/images/) for [VirtualBox](http://rpm-ostree.cloud.fedoraproject.org/project-atomic/images/f20/vbox) and [KVM/QEMU](http://rpm-ostree.cloud.fedoraproject.org/project-atomic/images/f20/qemu) images for virt-manager.

## Step by Step on virt-manager

Here's how to get started with Atomic on your machine using virt-manager on Linux.

1. Download the virt-manager image.

2. Run `xz -d [filename]` to uncompress the downloaded image.

3. Start virt-manager.

4. Run the File, New Virtual Machine menu command. The New VM dialog box will open.

5. Select the Import existing disk image option and click Forward. The next page in the New VM dialog will appear.

6. Click Browse. The Locate or create storage volume dialog will open.

7. Click Browse Local. The Locate existing storage dialog will open.

8. Navigate to the downloaded virtual machine file, select it, and click Open. The Locate existing storage dialog will close.

9. In the New VM dialog, select Linux for the OS type, Fedora 20 (or later) for the Version, and click Forward. The next page in the New VM dialog will appear.

10. Adjust the VM's RAM and CPU settings, if needed and click Forward. The next page in the New VM dialog will appear.

11. Assign a new name to the VM and click Finish. The Atomic instance will boot.

## Step by Step on VirtualBox

Here's how to get started with Atomic on your machine using VirtualBox on Windows, OS X or Linux.

1. Download the VirtualBox image.

2. Run `bzip2 -i [filename]` to uncompress the downloaded image.

3. Start VirtualBox.

4. Click the New icon on the VirtualBox toolbar. The Create Virtual Machine dialog box will open.

5. Enter a name for the new machine, select Linux for the Type, Fedora (64 bit) for the Version, and click Next. The Memory Size page in the Create Virtual Machine dialog will appear.

6. Adjust the VM's RAM if needed and click Next. The Hard Drive page in the Create Virtual Machine dialog will appear.

7. Select the Create a virtual hard drive now option and click Create. The Create Virtual Hard Drive dialog will open.

8. Select the option you want to use and click Next. The Storage on physical hard drive page will appear.

9. Choose the type of file allocation you want and click Next. The File location and size page will appear.
 
10. Select the location and size of the disk you need and click Create. The virtual hard drive will be created and the virtual machine will be ready.

## Configure Your Atomic Machine

After the Atomic virtual machine is created, it will be ready to use, though there will be some steps to take to prepare the VM for more efficient use.

1. Start the VM. On boot, the login prompt will appear.

2. Login as root, with no password.

3. Run `passwd` and set a password for your account.

4. Run `rpm-ostree upgrade` to upgrade rpm-ostree to the latest version.

5. Reboot your system to apply the upgrade.

## Readying More Space For Containers

Docker is ready to go at this point, but there's another fairly important bit of config to do, if you're going to be testing out more than a couple containers--you need to add a bigger drive for `/var/lib/docker`.

### Add A New Drive in virt-manager

1. Select the View, Details menu command on your VM window.

2. Click the Add Hardware. The Add New Virtual Hardware dialog box will open. 

3. Select Storage, change disk size to what you want, change bus type to VirtIO, and click Finish. The Add New Virtual Hardware dialog box will close. 

### Add A New Drive in VirtualBox

1. With the Atomic VM closed, select the Machine, Settings menu command. The Settings dialog box will open.

2. Select the Storage option. The Storage settings will appear.

3. Select the Controller for the VM and click the Add Hard Disk icon. A Question dialog will open.

4. Choose Create New Disk. The Create Virtual Hard Drive dialog box will open.

5. Follow the steps 7-10 above used in creating a new VirtualBox VM to make a new hard drive for the VirtualBox VM.

### Configuring the New Drive

1. Run `fdisk -l` to find name of your new disk (e.g., /dev/vdb)

2. Run `fdisk /dev/vdb`. 

3. In fdisk, type `n`, `p`, [Enter] three times, and `w` to make new partition on a new
disk.

4. Run `mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1`. This doesn't have to be xfs, it can be any filesystem type.

5. If you already have data in `/var/lib/docker` you want to keep, copy this data off to some backup directory.

6. Run `systemctl stop docker`.

7. Run `rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*`

8. Run `blkid /dev/vdb1`. Take note of the blkid.

9. Open /etc/fstab and add this line:

`UUID=<UUID-from-blkid> /var/lib/docker <file system type> defaults 1 1`

10. Run `mount -a`.

11. Run `systemctl start docker`. Docker is ready to go.
