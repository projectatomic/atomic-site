    %h2 Atomic Upgrades

    %p
      From a running host, start an upgrade with:
    %pre
      $ rpm-ostree upgrade
      $ systemctl reboot
    %p
      On the boot screen you'll see your new version. Hold down the
      SHIFT key there to rollback to your previous tree.

    %h2 Docker Containers

    %p
      Host applications on Atomic with #{link_to "Docker", "https://www.docker.io"}
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ docker run fedora /bin/echo "hello world"
    %p
      Get familiar with the #{link_to "Docker tutorial", "https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#"}, then
      learn how you can build reusable images and run Docker in production on Atomic hosts.

    %h2 Try the new UI for your Server

    %p
      Administer the services on your system with Cockpit
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ systemctl enable cockpit-ws.socket
        # visit http://localhost:21064 in a browser
    %p
      Cockpit is perfect for new sysadmins, allowing them to easily perform simple tasks such as storage 
      administration, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.

    %h2 Cluster your Containers

    %p
      Setup and link containers across hosts
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ gear deploy simple_web.json localhost
    %p
      Install containers to systemd and link them across a cluster with geard, the new core
      of OpenShift.

    %h2 Virtual Machines

    %p
      Virtualization on your own computer is an easy option to get
      started, but it also works great for container development.

    %p
      We have images and instructions for the most common platforms:
      KVM/QEmu, OpenStack, VMWare and Vagrant. 

    %p

      If there is no ready-to-run appliance image for your platform,
      as a fallback you can install Atomic with the installer ISO
      image.

    %h2 Public Cloud Providers

    %p

      Project Atomic images are available on most common public cloud
      providers, ready to run.

    %p
 
      We have preloaded images available for Amazon EC2 and Rackspace
      cloud. For other compatible cloud providers you can upload the
      provided image yourself, or use the installer ISO.

    %h2 Your own hardware

    %p 

      Atomic can be installed on most 64 bit X86 computers. Actual
      hardware requirements depend on your use case.

    %p

      If we must give a number to compare against, I would guess 256
      megabytes of memory would be a minimum for testing and
      experimenting with Atomic.
