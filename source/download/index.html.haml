  Atomic runs on most virtualization platforms and cloud providers. "Bare
  metal" installation on your own hardware is also possible.

%p.lead

  The most convenient way for you to get started with Project Atomic is for you 
  to make use of the technology you already use. That's why we've provided 
  appliance images and install media for the most common cases. We hope that 
  you find something that fits your needs.

    %h2 Virtual Machines

    %p
      Virtualization on your own computer is not only an easy option for 
      getting started, it also works well for container development.

    %p
      We have images and instructions for the most common platforms:
      KVM/QEmu, OpenStack, VMWare and Vagrant. 

    %p

      If there is no ready-to-run appliance image for your platform,
      as a fallback you can install Atomic with the installer ISO
      image.

    %h2 Public Cloud Providers

    %p

      Project Atomic images are available on most common public cloud
      providers, ready to run.

    %p
 
      Preloaded images are available for Amazon EC2 and Rackspace
      cloud. For other compatible cloud providers, upload the
      provided image yourself, or use the installer ISO.

    %h2 Your own hardware

    %p 

      Atomic can be installed on most 64 bit X86 computers. Actual
      hardware requirements depend on your use case.

    %p

      If we must give a number to compare against, I would guess 256
      megabytes of memory would be a minimum for testing and
      experimenting with Atomic.

  Quick Start Guide

%p Now that you've got Project Atomic installed, it's time to put it to work. And we have to write this quickstart guide so you can follow it. The purpose of this section is to get your newly installed Atomic controller to do something useful and to give you an understanding of how it works, how to install containers, and how to do common deployments.
