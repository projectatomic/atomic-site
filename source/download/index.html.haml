%p.lead 

  Atomic can run on most virtualization platforms and cloud providers. "Bare
  metal" installation on your own hardware is also possible.

%p.lead

  Usually the most convenient way to get started is the technology you
  already use, so we try to provide appliance images and install
  media for the most common cases. Hopefully you find something that
  fits your needs.

    %h2 Virtual Machines

    %p
      Virtualization on your own computer is an easy option to get
      started, but it also works great for container development.

    %p
      We have images and instructions for the most common platforms:
      KVM/QEmu, OpenStack, VMWare and Vagrant. 

    %p

      If there is no ready-to-run appliance image for your platform,
      as a fallback you can install Atomic with the installer ISO
      image.

    %h2 Public Cloud Providers

    %p

      Project Atomic images are available on most common public cloud
      providers, ready to run.

    %p
 
      We have preloaded images available for Amazon EC2 and Rackspace
      cloud. For other compatible cloud providers you can upload the
      provided image yourself, or use the installer ISO.

    %h2 Your own hardware

    %p 

      Atomic can be installed on most 64 bit X86 computers. Actual
      hardware requirements depend on your use case.

    %p

      If we must give a number to compare against, I would guess 256
      megabytes of memory would be a minimum for testing and
      experimenting with Atomic.

  Quick Start Guide

%p Now that you got Project Atomic installed, it's time to put it to work. And we have to write this quickstart guide so you can follow it. Basically the purpose of this section is to get your newly installed Atomic controller to do something useful and to make you understand how it works, how to install containers and how to do common deployments.
