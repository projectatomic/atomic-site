%h1 Get Started with Atomic

%img.pull-right( src="/images/platforms.png")

%p.lead 
  Atomic Host images are now available from Fedora and the CentOS Project. 

%p.lead
  Fedora 21 Atomic Cloud is available as part of the <a href="https://getfedora.org/cloud/download/">Fedora 21 Cloud</a> release. The <a href="http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic">CentOS Atomic SIG</a> has <a href="http://buildlogs.centos.org/monthly/7/">also produced an alpha image</a> with nightly updates forthcoming.
 
  The previous Fedora 20 prototype VM here was just a demonstration.

%p 
  The "QEMU" image works on Linux KVM virtualization, for example is 
  <a href="http://openstack.redhat.com/">RDO</a> (OpenStack), 
  <a href="http://ovirt.org">oVirt</a>, 
  <a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-manager</a> and
  the "Boxes" virtual machine application available in 
  <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> and <a href="http://centos.org/">CentOS 7</a>.

    %h2 Setting Up the Virtual Machine

    %p
      Please follow the
      %a( href="/docs/quickstart/" ) Quick Start Guide
      to create a new virtual machine with Atomic and set
      up more disk space for your containers.

    %h3 Extremely Quick Start Guide For the Impatient

    %p
      From here in, we'll refer to the Atomic VM as the "host," even though it's actually a VM. Atomic boots to a text console, asking you to log in.
      You need to create a metadata ISO for use with <a href="http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">cloud-init</a>.

      For example instructions on creating one, see: <a href="https://www.technovelty.org//linux/running-cloud-images-locally.html">this blog entry</a>.

    %h2 Atomic Upgrades

    %p
      From a running host, start an upgrade with:
    %pre
      \# rpm-ostree upgrade
      \# systemctl reboot
    %p
      On the boot screen you'll see your new version. Hold down the
      SHIFT key there to rollback to your previous tree.

    %h2 Docker Containers

    %p
      Host applications on Atomic with #{link_to "Docker", "https://www.docker.io"}
    %pre
      :preserve
        # docker run fedora /bin/echo "hello world"
    %p
      Get familiar with the #{link_to "Docker tutorial", "https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#"}, then
      learn how you can build reusable images and run Docker in production on Atomic hosts.

    %h2 Try the New UI for Your Server

    %p
      Administer the services on your system with Cockpit (Preview - not for production use)

    %pre
      :preserve
        # systemctl enable cockpit.socket
        # systemctl start cockpit.socket
        # visit http://&lt;ipaddress&gt;:9090 in a browser
    %p
      Cockpit is perfect for new sysadmins, allowing them to easily perform simple tasks such as storage 
      administration, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.

    %p
      The snapshot of Cockpit included in Atomic is a preview - do
      not use in production environments.  Cockpit is under rapid
      development.

    %h2 Learn about Kubernetes

    %p
      If you're looking to work with orchestration, you'll want to get started with Kubernetes.

    %p
      Scott Collier has been keeping a guide to getting started with Kubernetes on Fedora
      which shows how to get a simple master and minion setup going. 

    %p 
      The Getting Started on Fedora guide will walk you through installing the required packages,
      setting up the configuration, and more.

    %h2 Virtual Machines

    %p
      Virtualization on your own computer is an easy option to get
      started, but it also works great for container development.

    %p
      We have images and instructions for the most common platforms:
      KVM/QEmu, OpenStack, VMWare and Vagrant. 

    %p

      If there is no ready-to-run appliance image for your platform,
      as a fallback you can install Atomic with the installer ISO
      image.

    %h2 Public Cloud Providers

    %p

      Project Atomic images are available on most common public cloud
      providers, ready to run.

    %p
 
      We have preloaded images available for Amazon EC2 and Rackspace
      cloud. For other compatible cloud providers you can upload the
      provided image yourself, or use the installer ISO.

    %h2 Your Own Hardware

    %p 

      Atomic can be installed on most 64 bit X86 computers. Actual
      hardware requirements depend on your use case.

    %p

      If we must give a number to compare against, I would guess 256
      megabytes of memory would be a minimum for testing and
      experimenting with Atomic.
