    Project Atomic provides a template for a minimal operating system 
    (Atomic Controller) that is designed to host Docker containers effectively and 
    with reduced overhead. We provide atomic updates to the host OS, so you can rely 
    on running a tested and tried software distribution underneath.

  %p
    Cloud images are available for download, supporting VirtualBox, QEMU/KVM and OpenStack. Support for
    bare metal installation is coming.

    %h2 Making the Distribution Smaller and Faster
    %p
      An Atomic Controller is a slimmed-down system designed to run Docker 
      containers, built from upstream CentOS, Fedora, or Red Hat Enterprise 
      Linux RPMs. It provides the benefits of the original distribution, plus 
      the ability to perform atomic upgrades and rollbacks &mdash; giving the best 
      of both worlds: A modern update model from a Linux distribution you know 
      and trust.

    %p 
      This will be a chapter that ties all this to OSTree with links

    %h2 Enforcing Strict Security for Containers
    %p
      Atomic Controllers use SELinux to confine Docker containers with strong 
      mandatory access control to provide multi-tenant Docker systems with strong 
      security.

    %p 
      This will be a chapter that ties all this to SELinux and the rest.

    %h2 A Cockpit View of the Containers and OS
    %p
      Cockpit enables administration of Linux servers via a Web browser, letting 
      admins manage storage, services, and inspect journals straight from the browser 
      &mdash; but it doesn't preclude using other management tools or doing it straight 
      from the terminal. Cockpit has been extended to help you manage containers as well, 
      giving you full control over your IT resources.

    %p 
      This will be a chapter that ties all this to Cockpit and stuff, linking for more info

    %h2 Integrated <strong>and</strong> Portable
    %p
      Atomic taps GearD to install and link Docker containers into systemd and 
      coordinate these containers across hosts. What's more, you can extend Atomic 
      Controller with additional software such as monitoring agents by creating 
      privileged containers which can access the host system.

    %p
      This to-be-written chapter ties the above to GearD and systemd.
