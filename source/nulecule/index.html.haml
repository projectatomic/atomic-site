%h1 The Nulecule Specification

%p.lead

  Nulecule defines a pattern and model for packaging complex multi-container
  applications, referencing all their dependencies, including orchestration
  metadata in a container image for building, deploying, monitoring,
  and active management.

%p

  Nulecule specification enables complex applications to be defined, packaged
  and distributed using standard container technologies. The resulting container
  includes dependencies while supporting multiple orchestration providers and
  ability to specify resource requirements. The Nulecule specification also
  supports aggregation of multiple composite applications. The Nulecule
  specification is container and orchestration agnostic, enabling the use of
  any container and orchestration engine.

%p
  It's a made-up word meaning "the mother of all atomic particles" [pronounced: noo-le-kyul], like "molecule".

    %h2 Reference Implementation

    %p
      <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp">Atomic App</a> is a reference implementation of the Nulecule Specification.
      It can be used to bootstrap container applications and to install and run them. Atomic App is designed to be run in a container
      context. Examples using this tool may be found in the <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/tree/master/examples">Nulecule examples directory</a>.

    %h2 Get involved

    %p
      The code source and Dockerfile to generate an Atomic App base image
      are hosted on the
      <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp">Atomic App</a>
      repo on GitHub.

    %p
      If you have a well identified issue, report
      it in Atomic App's issues section hosted on github. Remember: first
      <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/issues">check existing issues</a>, then
      <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/issues/new">enter a new issue</a>. We appreciate your bugs!
